Data from the NextSeq comes in fastq's instead of qseqs. We will separate these for ease of processing in the pipeline.

# Description

drug-4 - Two biological repeats of 3 isoproterenol conditions (0, 0.150, 0.625 uM) and forskolin (30x cell increase)

drug-6 - Sequencing repeat of drug-4 (in `../qseqs` folder) on the NextSeq

drug-7 - Two biological repeats of 3 isoproterenol conditions (0, 0.150, 0.625 uM) and forskolin (30x cell increase/huge cDNA increase)
